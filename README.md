# starboard-exporter

Exposes Prometheus metrics from [Starboard][starboard-upstream]'s `VulnerabilityReport` custom resources (CRs).

## Metrics

This exporter exposes two types of metrics:

### Summary

A summary series exposes the count of CVEs of each severity reported in a given `VulnerabilityReport`. For example:

```shell
starboard_exporter_vulnerabilityreport_image_vulnerability_severity_count{
    image_digest="",
    image_namespace="demo",
    image_repository="giantswarm/starboard-operator",
    image_tag="0.11.0",
    report_name="replicaset-starboard-app-6894945788-starboard-app",
    severity="MEDIUM"
    } 4
```

### Detail / Vulnerability

A detail or vulnerability series exposes fields from each instance of an Aqua `Vulnerability`. The value of the metric is the `Score` for the vulnerability. For example:

```shell
starboard_exporter_vulnerabilityreport_image_vulnerability{
    fixed_resource_version="1.1.1l-r0",
    image_digest="",
    image_namespace="demo",
    image_repository="giantswarm/starboard-operator",
    image_tag="0.11.0",
    installed_resource_version="1.1.1k-r0",report_name="replicaset-starboard-app-6894945788-starboard-app",
    severity="HIGH",
    vulnerability_id="CVE-2021-3712",
    vulnerability_link="https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2021-3712",
    vulnerability_title="openssl: Read buffer overruns processing ASN.1 strings",vulnerable_resource_name="libssl1.1"
    } 7.4
```

#### A Note on Cardinality

For some use cases, it is helpful to export additional fields from `VulnerabilityReport` CRs. However, because many fields contain unbounded arbitrary data, including them in Prometheus metrics can lead to extremely high cardinality. This can drastically impact Prometheus performance. For this reason, we only expose summary data by default and allow users to opt-in to higher-cardinality fields.

## Customization

Summary metrics of the format described above are always enabled.

To enable an additional detail series *per Vulnerability*, use the `--target-labels` flag to specify which labels should be exposed. For example:

```shell
# Expose only select image and CVE fields.
--target-labels=image_namespace,image_repository,image_tag,vulnerability_id

# Run with (almost) all fields exposed as labels, if you're feeling really wild.
--target-labels=all
```
